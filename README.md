Case #1 
A LIVING WAGE FOR SYRACUSE A   growing number   of cities   in the United   States   have passed   living   wage   legislation   in   recent   years. These   laws   require   that   affected   workers   be   paid   a   minimum   wage   that   is   higher   than   required   by   federal   minimum   wage   laws.   In   2007,   the   U.S.   minimum   wage   reached   $7.25   per   hour. Typical   minimum   wages   mandated   by   living   wage   laws range   from   $8   -   $10 per hour.    In   some   cities,   nearly   all   workers   are   affected.      In   others,   only   workers   employed   by   the   government,   or   by   companies   doing   business   with   the   government,   are   covered   by   the   living   wage requirement.Recently, the   city of Syracuse considered a   living   wage   law.      The   law   would   only   apply   to   employees   of   the   city,   employees   of contractors   that   do   more   than   $20,000 worth   of work   for   the   city,   or   employees   of companies   that   receive more than   $20,000 in   economic   development   aid   from the city.      The   living   wage   legislation   would   define   any workers   meeting these   characteristics   as   “eligible workers”,   and require   that   they   be   paid   at   least   $10.96   per   hour.In   preparation   for   debate   on   the   living   wage   legislation,   you   have   been   asked   by   a   member   Syracuse   Common   Council   to   prepare   a   two-page   memo   summarizing   the   potential   impact   of   the   legislation.      The   representative   has asked   you   to   provide   estimates   of the   following:      how   employment   levels   will   change   in   response   to   the   policy   and   how   workers’   incomes   will   be   changed   by   this   policy. Your   analysis   should   consider   not   only   the   effect   of   the legislation on those directly covered by the   living wage, but   also   how   (if   at   all)   other   labor   market   participants will   be   affected.   The   councilor   wants   to   be   prepared   to   respond   in   the   debate   to   concerns   raised   by   the   business   community   about   the   impact   of this   policy   on   the   labor   market   for   non-eligible   workers.       She   also   wants   to   be   prepared   to   ask   and   respond   to   questions   about   which   groups   within   her   constituency   will   be   harmed   or   helped   by the proposed policy.To   aid   your   analysis,   you   have   been   provided   with   the   following   information   (some   real,   some   hypothetical).   Please   note   that   some   of the   information   provided   may   be   irrelevant. You   may   assume   that   a   typical   full-time   worker works 40 hours per week, and works 50 weeks per year.

In   addition   to   the   above   demographic   data,   your   research   has   uncovered   the   following   economic   parameters.   Estimates   of   the   elasticity   of   labor   demand   with   respect   to   wages   for   low-wage   workers   are –0.1   in the short run   and –0.3   in the   long run. To   interpret   these   elasticities,   think   of   the   wage   levels   per   hour   as   the   price   of   labor,   workers   as   suppliers   of   labor,   and   employers   as   demanders   of   labor. Furthermore, your research staff estimates that, when possible, 35% of workers laid-off off in each wage group will find   employment   with   non   affected   employers   looking   for   the   same   type   of   labor   within   city   limits,   and   an   additional 15% will   be   hired   by   non-affected   employers   in   the   surrounding   suburbs.       (Hint: for one group of wage-earners, finding similar positions will not be possible due to the federal minimum wage policy.) 
Based on this information, you have been asked to address the following questions   in your memo:
1)       How many workers in each wage group will lose   jobs as   a result   of   the   living wage   legislation?
2)       Of   these, how   many   remain   unemployed, and   how   many   obtain   jobs   elsewhere?
3)       How,   if   at   all, will   the   re-hiring   of   these   workers   affect   the   wages   of   workers   not   covered   by   the   living   wage law?    If   wages will change, please calculate the amount   by   which   they   will   change.      As   the   council   member   is concerned   about   workers   under   her jurisdiction,   you   only need   to   calculate   this   for   other   workers   within   the   city limits.
Finally, the council member would like to know if   certain   groups   will   be   affected   more   than   others. In   addition   to   considering how different wage groups might be affected, you have been provided with the following   data:
                                                                                                                                % in affected                        % in overall

Be   certain   to   indicate the extent to which your recommendation is   based   on   your   analysis   and   the   extent   to   which   it   is   based   on   your   personal   value   judgments.As   the   contents   of your   memo   will   be   used   to   prepare   the   council   member   for   debate,   it   is   important   that   this   information   be   presented   in   a direct, non-technical manner that   is   accessible   to   non-economists.       As   such,   the   council   member   has   asked   that   you   limit   your   analysis   to   two   pages   and   to   avoid   the   use   of   economic   jargon.
